Great managers notice your energy level.</p> <p>Being an introvert is not an excuse to avoid treating people like human beings. Your manager should treat you like a human that has a life outside work, you should expect to talk a few minutes about that life when you meet.</p> <p><strong>It is an opportunity to speak privately.</strong> You should expect 1-1s to be scheduled with some predictability, so that you can plan for them.</p> <p>Good 1-1s are not status meetings. You can use the email or chat for those.</p> <p>It’s a good idea to come with an agenda of things to discuss.</p> <h3 id="feedback-and-workplace-guidance"> <a href="#feedback-and-workplace-guidance" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="feedback-and-workplace-guidance"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Feedback and workplace guidance </h3> <p>Good managers will let you know when you screw up. The sooner you know about your bad habits the easier they will be to correct.</p> <p><strong>Praise should be public and criticism should be private.</strong></p> <p>If you do things apart from code, your manager should help you out to improve in those things. Asking for advice is a great way to show respect to her. <strong>Your manager is your number one ally.</strong></p> <p>In difficult situations with your teammate or people from other teams, your manager should be there to help you navigate the situation.</p> <p>Good managers will also help you understand the value of the work you are doing when is not fun or glamourous.</p> <p>The more senior you become, the less feedback you will be likely to receive. You should become comfortable driving your 1-1s.</p> <h3 id="training-and-career-growth"> <a href="#training-and-career-growth" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="training-and-career-growth"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Training and career growth </h3> <p>Your manager holds some responsibility helping you out with training and other resources for career growth.</p> <p>Your manager should be essential in advocating for your promotion and getting approved. She should also know if you are qualified to be promoted. Managers cannot guarantee promotions, but good ones will know how to help you out to perform well in the system.</p> <h3 id="you-are-responsible-for-yourself"> <a href="#you-are-responsible-for-yourself" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="you-are-responsible-for-yourself"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> You are responsible for yourself </h3> <p>Knowing yourself is step one. Step two is going after what you want.</p> <p>When you want to work on a project, ask. When you are persistently unhappy, speak out. You will not get everything you want, and asking is not fun, but it’s the fastest way forward.</p> <h3 id="give-your-manager-a-break"> <a href="#give-your-manager-a-break" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="give-your-manager-a-break"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Give your manager a break </h3> <p><strong>The job of your manager is to do the best thing for the company and the team, not to do whatever it takes to make you happy.</strong></p> <p>The only person you can change is yourself. Your manager expect you to bring solutions, not problems.</p> <h3 id="choose-your-managers-wisely"> <a href="#choose-your-managers-wisely" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="choose-your-managers-wisely"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Choose your managers wisely </h3> <p>Consider not only the job, the company and the pay, but also the manager when evaluating job opportunities.

Listening is the precursor of empathy, which is one of the core skills of a quality manager. When you mentee is speaking to you, pay attention to your behaviour. Listening goes beyond hearing words, people are not usually precise on what they mean. Let your mentee correct you.</li> <li><strong>Communicate clearly.</strong> Communicate what needs to happen.</li> <li><strong>Calibrate your response.</strong> During the first weeks of the internship, you’ll learn the frequency you need to check in with your mentee to provide the right adjustments.</li> </ul> <h4 id="mentoring-a-new-hire"> <a href="#mentoring-a-new-hire" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="mentoring-a-new-hire"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Mentoring a new hire </h4> <p>Your job consists of onboarding this person in the company effectively, helping out adjusting to the life in the company and building out her network of contacts. There will be many opportunities to clarify many bits of process, culture and jargon that will be completely foreign to a new joiner.</p> <p>Effective teams have good onboarding documents to provide to new hires.</p> <p>Part of the mentoring is introducing the new person around, bringing this person into some of your networks will help her to get up to speed faster. Adopt the mindset that network building is a worthwhile investment of your time and energy.</p> <h4 id="technical-career-mentoring"> <a href="#technical-career-mentoring" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="technical-career-mentoring"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Technical career mentoring </h4> <p>The best mentoring relationships evolve naturally and in the context of larger work.</p> <ul> <li><strong>When you are a mentor.</strong> Don’t do it unless you think it will be rewarding for you and the person you’re mentoring. Don’t say yes and then fail to actually do the mentoring work.</li> <li><strong>When you are a mentee.</strong> Think about what you want to get out of this relationship, and come prepared to your sessions. If you don’t have time to prepare or you don’t think preparing is necessary, ask yourself if mentoring is really something you need at all. Maybe instead you need a friend, or a therapist, or a coach.</li> </ul> <h3 id="good-manager-bad-manager-the-alpha-geek"> <a href="#good-manager-bad-manager-the-alpha-geek" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="good-manager-bad-manager-the-alpha-geek"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Good manager, bad manager: the alpha geek </h3> <p>The alpha geek is driven to be the best engineer on the team, to always have the right answer, and to be the person who solves all the hard problems. He values intelligence and technical skill above all other traits. Can’t deal with dissent. He has all the answers. <strong>The alpha geek tries to create a culture of excellence, but ends up creating a culture of fear.</strong></p> <p>The alpha geek believes that every developer should know exactly what she knows, and if you don’t know something, she will point out your ignorance. She can be very rigid about how things should be done and closed off to new ideas that she didn’t come up with.</p> <p><strong>If you have ever wondered why people don’t seem to come to you for help despite your clearly strong technical skills, ask yourself whether you’re showing some signs of being an alpha geek.</strong></p> <p>Mentoring can be a great opportunity to break out of that habit. <strong>Practicing the art of teaching can help us learn how to nurture and coach, how to phrase things so that others will listen, instead of just shouting them down.</strong></p> <p><strong>Alpha geeks make absolutely terrible managers.</strong> Better off to give them a focus on technical strategies and system design.</p> <h3 id="tips-for-the-manager-of-a-mentor"> <a href="#tips-for-the-manager-of-a-mentor" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="tips-for-the-manager-of-a-mentor"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Tips for the manager of a mentor </h3> <p>What you measure, you improve. You help your team succeed by creating clear, focused, measurable goals. Figure out what you’re hoping to achieve then find the person who can help meet those goals. If your company is setting up mentoring programs, make sure that there is some guidance and structure.</p> <p>Recognise that the mentor productivity will slow down during the mentoring period. Look for someone that you believe can succeed who wants to distinguish herself beyond her coding ability.</p> <p>Skills that address emotional needs of people and teams. Because the outcome can be difficult to quantify is often dismissed as less important. Mentors need to be recognised, should be treated as first-class citizens.</p> <p>Best mentors are going to be people who are further along in their mastery of the job skills that the mentee is trying to develop.</p> <p>Use this opportunity to reward and train future leaders of your team.</p> <h3 id="key-takeaways-for-the-mentor"> <a href="#key-takeaways-for-the-mentor" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="key-takeaways-for-the-mentor"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Key takeaways for the mentor </h3> <ul> <li><strong>Be curious and open-minded.</strong> When we close our minds and stop learning, we start to lose the most valuable skill for maintaining and growing a successful technical career. Working with new people who are learning things for the first time can shed light on hidden patterns and help you make connections you may not otherwise have made.</li> <li><strong>Listen and speak their language.</strong> Mentoring forces you to hone your communication skills. You must be able to listen and communicate in a way that the person can understand. Teams have to communicate effectively to get anything done.</li> <li><strong>Make connections</strong>. Your career ultimately succeeds or fails on the strength of your network. Mentoring is a great way to build this network. Your career is long and the tech world can be very small, so treat the other person well.</li> </ul> <h2 id="tech-lead"> <a href="#tech-lead" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="tech-lead"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Tech lead </h2> <p>The idea that the tech lead role should automatically be given to the most experienced engineer, the one who can handle the most complex features or who writes the best code, is a common misconception that even experienced managers fall for.</p> <p><em>The tech lead role is not a point in the latter, but a set of responsibilities that any engineer may take once they reach the senior level.</em></p> <ul> <li>Regular (weekly) 1-1 touchbases</li> <li>Regular feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted.</li> <li>Working with reports to identify areas for learning and helping them grow in these areas via project work, external learning, or additional mentoring.</li> </ul> <p>The tech lead is learning how to be a strong technical project manager by delegating work effectively without micromanaging.

It’s natural to feel some longing for simpler times. You can’t do everything all at once. Becoming a great manager requires you to focus on the skills of management, and that requires giving up some of your technical focus. It’s a tradeoff, and one you’ll have to decide if you’re up to making.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="managing-your-time-whats-important-anyway"> <a href="#managing-your-time-whats-important-anyway" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="managing-your-time-whats-important-anyway"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Managing your time: what’s important, anyway? </h3> <p>It’s time to figure out how to manage your time.

We also tend to substitute <em>obvious</em> for <em>urgent</em> in determining something’s value.</p> <p>It’s likely that you’re spending a lot of your time on things that are urgent but only slightly important, and sacrificing things that are important but not urgent. Important but not urgent is actually preparing for meetings so that you can guide them.</p> <p>As a manager of multiple teams, you can win back a lot of time by pushing an efficient meeting culture down to your teams.</p> <p>When you stop going to all of their internal meetings, you run the risk of missing out on the clues that will help you catch problems early. Your attendance at these meetings is partially to pay attention to the dynamics and morale of your team.</p> <p>Ask yourself: <strong>How important is the thing I’m doing?</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>If your team needs a manager more than they need an engineer, you have to accept that being a manager means that you by definition can’t be that engineer. If you are going to suck at one, which one that will be. I feel bad when I suck at being an engineer, but sucking at being a manager would be a choice inflicted on other people. That’s not fair.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="decisions-and-delegation"> <a href="#decisions-and-delegation" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="decisions-and-delegation"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Decisions and delegation </h3> <p>The first several months of managing multiple teams can feel like a death march, even when your hours are not excessive.</p> <p>The only way out of this situation is to go through it.

Making a policy helps your team know in advance the cost of getting to “yes”.</li> <li><strong>“Help me say yes”</strong>. Means you ask questions and dig on the elements that seem so questionable to you. This line of questioning helps people come to the realisation themselves that their plan isn’t a good idea.</li> <li><strong>Appeal to budget</strong>. Lay out the current workload in plain terms, and show how there is little room to maneuver. “Not right now”.</li> <li><strong>Don’t prevaricate</strong>. When you know that you need to say no, it’s better to say it quickly that to delay and drag out the process.

Frequency of code change is one of the leading indicators of a healthy engineering team. Part of moving fast requires breaking work down into small chunks. As a technical leader, while you may not be writing code much, you’re still responsible for the technical side of getting work done. You’re also responsible for keeping your team happy and productive, and often the solution to this is not cheerleading or paying them better or praising them more. <strong>You have to be the advocate and push for technical process improvements that can lead to increased engineer productivity, even if you’re not implementing them all yourself.</strong></li> <li><strong>Frequency of code check-ins</strong>. The importance of breaking stuff into chunks. Engineers who don’t write tests often have a harder time breaking down their work, and learning how to test-driven development can help them better at this skill.</li> <li><strong>Frequency of incidents</strong>. Determining the level of software quality you need for the product you’re building and adjusting that measure over time is a technical challenge for you, the manager, to help address. Developers support code or systems they write. Incident management, when it becomes merely reacting to incidents rather than working to reduce them, can turn into a task that diminishes your team’s ability to do what they do best.</li> </ul> <h3 id="good-manager-bad-manager-us-versus-them-team-player"> <a href="#good-manager-bad-manager-us-versus-them-team-player" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="good-manager-bad-manager-us-versus-them-team-player"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Good manager, bad manager: us versus them, team player. </h3> <p>It can be hard for new managers to create a shared team identity. They unite the team by empathising how this identity is special as compared to other teams.

This attitude make the team vulnerable of many dysfunctions.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Fragile to the loss of the leader</strong>. When you hire a manager who builds a clique, that clique is likely to dissolve and leave the company if the manager leaves the company.</li> <li><strong>Resistant to outside ideas</strong>.

A skip-level meeting it’s a meeting with people who report to people who report to you. Their purpose is to help you get perspectives on the health and focus of your teams.</p> <p>It’s a short 1-1 meeting, held perhaps once a quarter, between the head of an organisation and each person in that organisation. It’s a personal relationship between you and everyone in your organisation. It also gives individuals time to ask you questions. Each person should come prepared to focus on what he or she is interested in talking to you about.</p> <p>Possible prompts for a skip-level 1-1:</p> <ul> <li>What do you like best/worst about the project you are working on?</li> <li>Who on your team has been doing really well recently?</li> <li>Do you have any feedback about your manager, what’s going well, what isn’t?</li> <li>What changes do you think we could make to the product?</li> <li>Are there any opportunities you think we might be missing?</li> <li>How do you think the organisation is doing overall? Anything we could be doing better/more/less?</li> <li>Are there any areas of the business strategy you don’t understand?</li> <li>What’s keeping you from doing your best work right now?</li> <li>How (un)happy are you working at the company?</li> <li>What could we do to make working at the company more fun?</li> </ul> <p>If you have a larger organisation, there are other ways to get skip-level time. Like holding lunches with whole teams a couple of times a quarter for each team.</p> <p>However, people act differently in group scenarios. It is a good opportunity to get a sense for where the team believed their focus needed to be. Some questions that can be used to draw out information:</p> <ul> <li>What can I, your manager’s manager, provide for you or your team? Anything I should be helping with?</li> <li>Is this team working poorly with any other teams, from your perspective?</li> <li>Are there any questions I can answer?</li> </ul> <p>Skip-level lunches provide familiarity, which in turn generates more willingness for people to come to you.</p> <p>At this level, you’re constantly making tradeoffs between investing in expensive engagements, such as 1-1s, or casual engagements that are more efficient but provide less detailed information.</p> <h3 id="manager-accountability"> <a href="#manager-accountability" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="manager-accountability"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Manager accountability </h3> <p>There is one universal goal for these relationship: <em>they should make your life easier</em>. Your managers should allow you to spend more time on the bigger picture, and less time on the details of any one team.</p> <p>Sometimes managers make your life easier by hiding problems and telling you what you want to hear, until months later you see things failing apart and wonder where you went wrong. <strong>You have to hold managers accountable</strong>.</p> <p>The manager ultimately needs to take responsibility for pulling the team out of problematic situations (unstable product roadmap, errand tech lead, full-time firefighting mode). <strong>The manager is accountable for the health and productivity of the team.</strong></p> <p>When the product organisation is constantly changing goals, the manager should identify that the changes are causing problems on the team, and work with product to explain the problem and refocus on what’s important.</p> <p>If the team can’t do anything but fight fires, the manager should put together a plan for tackling causes of the fires, and if necessary bring requests for hiring more people or adding more people to the team so that they can get the situation under control.</p> <p>You’ll need to help your managers, sometimes they won’t have the energy to push back against product and they’ll need your support.</p> <p><strong>Managers need coaching and guidance in the same way that individual contributors need coaching and guidance.</strong></p> <h3 id="good-manager-bad-manager-the-people-pleaser"> <a href="#good-manager-bad-manager-the-people-pleaser" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="good-manager-bad-manager-the-people-pleaser"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Good manager, bad manager: the people pleaser </h3> <p>The people pleaser has deep aversion to ever directly making people he cares about unhappy. If you’re in the group that he cares, he’ll always say yes. People pleasers often burn themselves out.</p> <ul> <li>Her team loves her as a person but is increasingly frustrated with her as a manager.</li> <li>He’s more interested in a team that runs smoothly and avoids mistakes than really become excellent.</li> <li>When she is feeling bad, she wears it on her face, and the whole team lose confidence.</li> <li>He never pushes back work.</li> <li>She overpromises and underdelivers.</li> <li>He says yes to everyone and sends contradictory messages.</li> <li>She seems to know about all of the problems, but hasn’t directly addressed any of them.</li> </ul> <p>The <em>therapist</em> people pleaser can inspire huge loyalty, but unfortunately this can mean he amplifies drama and negativity, and disappoints his team by making promises that he cannot possibly keep.</p> <p>There is the <em>external</em> pleaser, the one that wants to make her boss and her external team partners happy, and is terrified of revealing problems on her team.</p> <p><strong>The people pleaser struggles to say no.</strong></p> <p><strong>These managers make it hard for the team to fail in a healthy way</strong>, because of the manager’s own fears of failure and possible rejection. An externally focused people pleaser shuts down honest conversation by evasion. A team pleaser fails by promising things that aren’t realistic, making the team bitter toward either the manager or the company for failure to live up to these inflated expectations.</p> <p>If it happens you end up managing somebody in this situation, you can work on help the person feel safer saying no and externalising more decisions so he doesn’t take failure personally. Providing strong partners who can take on the task of determining the work roadmap. Creating better processes for getting work scheduled, having a structure that specifies the requirements for getting promotions or accessing other opportunities, the people pleaser can rightly point to the process as something outside of her control.</p> <p>One of the best things you can do is show the person that he’s exhibiting the behaviour, and highlight the downsides.</p> <h3 id="managing-new-managers"> <a href="#managing-new-managers" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="managing-new-managers"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Managing new managers </h3> <p>First-time managers need a lot of coaching, it will be an up-front cost that pays long-term dividends for your organisation.</p> <p>No book or training can replace you spending some time asking your new manager how her 1-1s are going.</p> <p>When people start quitting because their manager hasn’t give them a career path or isn’t inspiring them, it’s the ultimately your responsibility. Use skip-level meeting to help out detect areas where you need to support your new manager fully.</p> <p><strong>A new manager who is working all the time is probably failing to hand off her old responsibilities to other people on her team.</strong> Make it clear that you expect the new manager to hand off some of her old work, and help her identify opportunities to do so.</p> <p><strong>Managers who neglect the job are bad, but managers that take to the job with gusto because they believe it’s the key to realising authority are worse.</strong> A skip-level meeting will reveal their frustration that they have no ability to make decisions themselves. If your new manager is skipping your 1-1s or evading questions about what the team is working on, you may have a control freak on your hands.</p> <p><strong>The manager you’re training should be ultimately making your job easier</strong>. Clearly set the expectations up front that you’ll hold her accountable for the team, and help her build the skills to achieve this.</p> <p>If they truly don’t have the willingness to learn and the aptitude to become solid managers, they’re a big problem. <strong>Making the wrong person a manager is a mistake, but keeping her in that position once you’ve realise she’s wrong for it is a critical error.</strong></p> <h3 id="managing-experienced-managers"> <a href="#managing-experienced-managers" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="managing-experienced-managers"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Managing experienced managers </h3> <p>Management tends to be a very culture-specific task in a company, if you either work as a manager or hire a manager for a company that’s not a good culture fit, you’ll have problems.</p> <p>First challenge is making sure this person fits in with the culture of your team. Often we overvaluate expertise in product areas and allow it to blind us to cultural and process fit with our companies and teams.</p> <p>You need managers who understand how to work with teams who ship software frequently, who are comfortable with modern development process best practices, and who can inspire creative product-centric engineers.

You can role-play difficult situations, like dealing with an employee who is underperforming, or delivering a negative performance review.</p> <p>A manager must be able to debug teams. Ask the manager to describe a time when she ran a project that was behind schedule, and what she did in that scenario. Ask her to role-play with an employee who is thinking about quitting. Describe how she’s coached employees who were struggling.</p> <p>Ask about her management philosophy. If she doesn’t have one at all, that might be a red flag. What’s the role for a manager? How does she stay hands-on, how does she delegate?</p> <p>Speaking skills are useful for certain types of leadership but not all.</p> <p>Give her an abbreviated version of your standard technical interview.</p> <p>To check for cultural fit, you need first to understand the values of the company around you. If you value servant-leadership and you hire a manager who wants to dictate exact marching orders to the team, there will be a bad fit. Similarly, if you value collaboration and hire a manager who thinks that the loudest voice in any conversation should win, you will also have problems.</p> <p><strong>Managers shape their teams to their culture. If you hire a manager who doesn’t fit culturally with the team she’s managing, the manager will fail and you’ll have to fire her, or most of the team will quit and then you may still have to fire her.</strong></p> <p>Most new hires act in self-interest until they get to know their colleagues, and then they move into group interest.</p> <p><strong>Critical elements to hiring a new managers: the reference check.</strong> Ask the references to describe the ways the person succeeds as well as the ways she fails.

They are relentless in their pursuit of the “why”.</p> <p>Managing teams is a series of complex black boxes interacting with other black boxes. When the outputs aren’t as expected, figuring out <em>why</em> requires trying to open them up and see what’s going on inside.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Have a hypothesis</strong>. You need a reasonable hypothesis that explains how the system got into the failed state.</li> <li><strong>Check the data</strong>. Look at the team chats and emails, look at the tickets, look at the repository code reviews and check-ins. What do you see? Look at their calendars.</li> <li><strong>Observe the team</strong>. Now is the time to start doing some potentially destructive investigations. Sit in their meetings. Boring meeting are a sign. They may be a sign of inefficient planning on the part of the organisers. Good meetings have heavy discussion element, where opinions and ideas are drawn out of the team. Be aware, the act of observing changes the outcome, or rather, causes an outcome to happen.

This kind of thinking will get hopes up and then disappoint.</li> <li><strong>Dedicate 20% of your team’s schedule to “sustaining engineering”</strong>. Refactoring, bugs, improving engineering processes, doing minor cleanups, and providing support.</li> <li><strong>Understand how important engineering projects really are</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>Treat big technical projects the same way as product initiatives. <strong>Gather data to support yourself, and talk about what will be possible when the work is done.</strong> Pick your battles.</p> <p>Teams may even be disbanded or moved around in ways you don’t understand or agree with.

You’re accountable for making sure the team is placing its technical best in the right places. You can see where the ares of greatest need or opportunity lie.</li> <li><strong>Ask informed questions</strong>. Having accountability doesn’t mean that you personally do the research to find potential investments. You guide these investments by asking questions. You need to know enough about the work to sniff our misguided efforts and evaluate proposed investments.</li> <li><strong>Analise and explain engineering and business tradeoffs</strong>. Understanding the business and customer goals, you offer guidance as to which technical projects can achieve those goals within reasonable time frames.</li> <li><strong>Make specific requests</strong>. You still need to have enough understanding of the technology in your organisation to make specific requests without distracting the senior engineers with questions. <strong>Managers who don’t stay technical enough relay these questions on the team, and then relay the team’s response back up to management.

This person is capable of dropping into the details and making things happen at a low level. The VP is usually the one pushing the execution of ideas, while the CTO focuses on larger strategy and the position of technology within the company.</p> <p>She aligns the development roadmap to the hiring plan, planning out how teams need to evolve.</p> <p>The job for an VP of Engineering is both a big one and a detail-oriented one. This position must be able to gain people’s trust and show wisdom in management and leadership. Most engineers are reluctant to trust people without technical credibility.</p> <p>The VP of Engineering have some stake in organisational strategy, she sets goals to achieve business deliverables, closely aligned with the product team. She should have a strong business and product instinct and a track record of getting teams to deliver big projects, including the ability to negotiate deliverables.</p> <p>They want their teams to be happy, but it’s important to tie that happiness to a sense of accomplishment.

It follows that the tCTO is not necessarily the best engineer in the company.</p> <p><strong>The CTO should be a strategic technical executive the company needs in its current stage of evolution.</strong></p> <p>A CTO must care about and understand the business and she should be able to shape business strategy through the lens of technology. <strong>She is an executive first, a technologist second.</strong> The CTO may identify areas where technology can be used to create new or bigger lines of business.</p> <p>Strong CTOs also have significant management responsibility and influence. <strong>The CTO must protect the technology team from becoming a pure execution arm for ideas without tending to its own needs and its own ideas.</strong></p> <p>CTOs that don’t have management oversight over teams, technology becomes an execution arm and they cannot have much strategic influence. <strong>You can’t give up the responsibility of management without giving up the power that comes with it.</strong></p> <p><strong>If you give up management, you’re giving up the most important power you ever had over the business strategy, and you effectively have nothing but your organisational goodwill and your own two hands.</strong></p> <p>Being a CTO it’s a business strategy job first and foremost. It’s also a management job.

A very common clash occurs between people who are extremely analytically driven and those who are more creatively or intuitively focused. Another is between the people who prefer to embrace agility and change (and, yes, sometimes disorder) and those who push for more long-term planning, deadlines and budgets.

It won’t be appropriate to discuss these decisions with other people at the company. It is tempting to rant to those you consider friends and your reporting team, but this is a bad idea. <strong>As their leader, you can easily undermine their confidence by sharing worries that they can’t do anything to mitigate.</strong></p> <p><em>Care more</em> about people as individuals.

Neglecting the team culture is a sure-fire way to make your job harder.</p> <p>In startup culture, the ideas of “structure” and “process” are seen as pointless at best and harmful at worst. Startups believe that structure is the reason large companies move slowly.</p> <p>Instead of talking about structure, is better to talk about learning. Instead of talking about process, it’s better to talk about transparency. We don’t setup systems because structure and process have inherent value. We do it because we ant to learn from our successes and our mistakes, and to share those successes and encode the lessons so we learn from failures in a transparent way.</p> <p>Consider not only what you care about, but also how you can scale that knowledge and effort effectively.</p> <p>The important thing for leaders to be willing to do in those early days is to pic a strategy and run with it. You don’t need to find the perfect solution; you need to find something that will get your through to the next milestone.</p> <p>Sometimes companies decide to limit the decisions themselves, as in organisation that forgoes titles. Deciding not to decide right now is a popular option for new companies, because it really doesn’t matter at the scale of a few people.</p> <p><strong>Pretending to lack structure tends to create hidden power structures.</strong> In <a href="http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm">The Tyranny of Structurelessness</a> Jo Freeman describes a set of circumstances in which the unstructured group can work:</p> <ul> <li>It is task oriented. It is the task that basically structures the group.</li> <li>It is relatively small and homogeneous. Homogeneity is necessary to insure that participants have a “common language” for interaction.</li> <li>There is high degree of communication. Information must be passed on to everyone.</li> <li>There is a low degree of skill specialisation. Everything must be able to be done by more than one person. People become interchangeable parts.</li> </ul> <p><strong>When work is done to satisfy an immediate task, in a unified code base worked on by a team of interchangeables, the result is not usually a larger thoughtful structure, but a tweak here, a hack there.</strong> We usually end up refactoring the code to make it scalable, this involves identifying and explicitly drawing out structure in order to make code base easier to read and work in.</p> <p>That is the value of structure. Structure is how we scale, diversify, and take on more complex long-term tasks. In the same way that strong technical system designers are capable of identifying and shaping underlying system structures, strong leaders are capable of identifying and shaping underlying team structures and dynamics, and doing so in a way that supports the long-term goals.</p> <p>The earliest startup is like a driving car. As you grow, you graduate to a commercial flight. So you need to consider your movements more carefully. Finally you graduate to a spaceship, where you can’t make quick moves and the course is set long in advance, but you are capable of going very far and taking tons of people along the ride.</p> <h3 id="assessing-your-role"> <a href="#assessing-your-role" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="assessing-your-role"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Assessing your role </h3> <ul> <li><strong>People.</strong> Leaders who want a high degree of control over their organisation tend to need more structure in place to make sure their wishes are enacted.</li> <li><strong>Age.</strong> The longer a company is around, the more habits become entrenched. The longer the company has been around, the more likely it is to continue to survive.</li> <li><strong>Size of existing infrastructure.</strong> If you have few established business rules and little code or physical infrastructure, there is less need for structure. The more existing business rules and infrastructure you have, the more you’ll need clarity on how to handle them.</li> <li><strong>Risk tolerance.</strong> Your structures and process should reflect this.</li> </ul> <p>When failures occur, examine all aspects of reality that are contributing to those failures. The patterns you see are opportunities to evolve your structure, either by creating more or different structure or removing it. <strong>Using failure to guide evolution lets you apply structure at the right level. Success is often a poor teacher.</strong> If you want to learn from success, make sure you can identify the actually improvement you’re seeking.</p> <p>When every new hire slows down the team down for months because there is no onboarding process, that is a failure due to lack of structure. When people regularly leave the company because they have no path to advancement or career growth, that is a failure due to lack of structure. The third time you have a production outage because someone logged directly into the database and accidentally dropped a critical table, that is a failure due to lack of structure.

Processes should have value even when they are not followed perfectly, and that value should largely lie in the act of socialising change or risk to the team as a whole.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="practical-advice-depersonalise-decision-making"> <a href="#practical-advice-depersonalise-decision-making" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="practical-advice-depersonalise-decision-making"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Practical advice: depersonalise decision making </h3> <h4 id="code-review"> <a href="#code-review" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="code-review"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Code review </h4> <p>You want the process to be straightforward and efficient:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Be clear about code review expectations.</strong> Code review is largely a socialisation exercise, so that multiple team members have seen and are aware of the changed code.</li> <li><strong>Use a linter for style issues.</strong></li> <li><strong>Keep an eye on the review backlog.</strong> Limit how many outstanding review requests a person can have assigned to him.</li> </ul> <h4 id="the-outage-postmortem"> <a href="#the-outage-postmortem" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-outage-postmortem"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The outage postmortem </h4> <ul> <li><strong>Resist the urge to point fingers and blame.</strong></li> <li><strong>Look at the circumstances around the incident and understand the context of the events.</strong> Understand and identify the factors that contributed to this incident.</li> <li><strong>Be realistic about which takeaways are important and which are worth dropping.</strong> Pick the one or two that are truly high-risk and highly likely to cause future problems, and acknowledge the ones that you are going to let go for now.</li> </ul> <h4 id="architecture-review"> <a href="#architecture-review" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="architecture-review"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Architecture review </h4> <p>The goal of architecture review is to help socialise big changes to the appropriate group, and to make the risks for those changes clear.</p> <ul> <li>How many people on the team are comfortable using this new system/writing this new language?</li> <li>Do you have production standards in place for this new thing?</li> <li>What is the process for rolling this out and training people to use it?</li> <li>Are there new operational considerations for using this?</li> </ul> <p>Some guidelines:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Be specific about the kinds of changes that need architecture review.</strong> Usually these include new languages, new frameworks, new storage systems, and new developer tooling.</li> <li><strong>The value of architecture review is in preparing for the review.</strong> It forces people to think about why they want to make these changes.
