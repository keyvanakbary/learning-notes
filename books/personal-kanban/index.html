Lack of context creates waste, resulting in long work days, poor planning, and the inability to keep commitments outside the office.</p> <p>Tools should give you control and not take anything.</p> <h2 id="the-basics-of-personal-kanban"> <a href="#the-basics-of-personal-kanban" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-basics-of-personal-kanban"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The basics of Personal Kanban </h2> <p>You need a way to actually <em>see</em> the tasks you’re expected to perform so you can do the right work at the right time. Personal Kanban is a visual representation of work that makes the conceptual tangible. It shows what needs to be done, what is complete, what is being delayed, and what is going on at this precise moment.</p> <p>Visualisation tools:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lists</strong>: Offer zero context for work, allow no reorganisation or repriorisation, and obscure vital priorities beneath piles of marginally useful work.</li> <li><strong>Mind map</strong>: It’s an improvement versus lists. It doesn’t help to complete tasks or distinguish between work shared by multiple people. Its greatest limitation is that the information conveyed is not obvious.</li> <li><strong>Kanban</strong>: It works great for software development. Its focus on team work increases productivity and effectiveness. It shows the flow of work, limit the work-in-progress, and it captures all tasks, not just those directly related to software production. It is flexible enough to relate extremely variable or even chaotic workload.</li> </ul> <h3 id="rules"> <a href="#rules" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="rules"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Rules </h3> <ol> <li><strong>Visualise your work</strong>. It’s challenging to understand what we can’t see. When we see work in its various contexts, real trade-offs become explicit. We now have a physical record of all those demands on our time. This allow us to make better decisions.</li> <li><strong>Limit your work-in-progress (WIP)</strong>. We cannot do more than we are capable of doing. This seems obvious, but it’s not. Our capacity for work is limited by a host of factors including the amount of time we have, the predictability of the task at hand, our level of experience with the task type, our energy level, the amount of work we currently we have in progress. Limiting our WIP allows us the time to focus, work quickly, react calmly to change, and do a thoughtful job.</li> </ol> <p>With Personal Kanban, principles take precedence over process. Process should change with context.</p> <p>When we see the landscape of our work, we identify better courses of action because have clarity.</p> <h3 id="why-call-it-personal-kanban"> <a href="#why-call-it-personal-kanban" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="why-call-it-personal-kanban"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Why call it Personal Kanban </h3> <p>Personal Kanban tracks items of importance to the individual: tasks, appointments, small projects (<em>work</em>).</p> <p>Organisational Kanban tracks items of value to the organisation. The goal is to understand the predictable and repeatable process of creating something. It focuses on standard work products, organisational efficiencies, and waste reduction.</p> <p>People are less predictable than organisations. We want to understand the nature of our work, but not force it. Innovation relies on inspiration through exploration and experimentation.</p> <p>Lean is both a philosophy and a discipline which, at its core, increases access to information to ensure responsible decision making in the service of creating value.</p> <p><em><strong>Kaizen</strong></em> is a state of continuous improvement where people naturally look for ways to improve poorly performing practices.</p> <p>When we visualise our work, we adopt a kaizen mindset; we are weened from the comfort of complacency and actively seek out opportunities for improvement.</p> <h3 id="why-it-works"> <a href="#why-it-works" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="why-it-works"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Why it works </h3> <p>When we are able to represent each of our tasks, it becomes tangible. Touching, feeling physically interacting with our tasks transforms work-as-a-concept into work-as-a-concrete-experience. Each time we move a sticky note, we receive kinesthetic feedback: the tactile action is both a data point and a reward. A regular succession of these movements creates a cadence, a rhythm of work.</p> <blockquote> <p>Good leaders provide enough management oversight to give a clear and coherent idea of vision and purpose, but not to the extent that they micromanage. They ensure employees have the information they need to make good decisions, and then step back to let the good decisions happen.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="building-your-first-personal-kanban"> <a href="#building-your-first-personal-kanban" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="building-your-first-personal-kanban"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Building your first Personal Kanban </h2> <h3 id="step-one-get-your-stuff-ready"> <a href="#step-one-get-your-stuff-ready" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="step-one-get-your-stuff-ready"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Step one: get your stuff ready </h3> <blockquote> <p>I’ve never drawn the same kanban twice</p> </blockquote> <p>The more you use your Personal Kanban, the more you’ll need to tailor it to the situation at hand.</p> <h3 id="step-two-establish-your-value-stream"> <a href="#step-two-establish-your-value-stream" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="step-two-establish-your-value-stream"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Step two: establish your value stream </h3> <p>Value Stream: The flow of work from beginning to completion</p> <p>The most simple value stream is <strong>READY</strong> (working waiting to be processed), <strong>DOING</strong> (work-in-progress), and <strong>DONE</strong> (completed work).</p> <h3 id="step-three-establish-your-backlog"> <a href="#step-three-establish-your-backlog" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="step-three-establish-your-backlog"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Step three: establish your backlog </h3> <p>Backlog: Work you have yet to do.</p> <p>When <em>there is way too much work</em>, overcoming denial, acknowledging the pain, and accepting it needs addressing are stages necessary in understanding our work.</p> <p>Lay out the backlog sticky notes next to your board. Decide which tasks need to be completed first and pull them into your <strong>READY</strong> column.</p> <h3 id="step-four-establish-your-wip-limit"> <a href="#step-four-establish-your-wip-limit" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="step-four-establish-your-wip-limit"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Step four: establish your WIP limit </h3> <p>WIP limit: the amount of work you can handle at any given time.</p> <p>The human brain needs closure (Zeigarnik Effect). Unfinished tasks vie for our attention, causing intrusive thoughts that ultimately impede productivity and increase the opportunity for error creating an anxiety feedback loop. Becoming psychologically or physically debilitating.</p> <p>Once you move a sticky note to DONE you know your work is done and you can focus on finishing the next task. Working like this is fulfilling.</p> <p>The close you get to reaching your capacity, the more stress taxes your brain’s resources, and impacts your performance.</p> <p><strong>Research consistently shows we cannot reach our maximum effectiveness while multitasking. Instead, maximum effectiveness results when we limit our WIP and focus on the task before us.</strong></p> <p>Start by setting an arbitrary WIP limit. Add this number to your DOING column. Expect that number to change.</p> <h3 id="step-five-begin-to-pull"> <a href="#step-five-begin-to-pull" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="step-five-begin-to-pull"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Step five: begin to pull </h3> <p>Pull: To bring a task into DOING you have capacity for it.</p> <p>Each time you pull a task from READ into DOING you’re prioritising based on your current context. Pull no more than your WIP limit.</p> <p>The physical act of moving sticky notes to change their status satisfies our brain’s need for closure.</p> <p>We pull work into DOING only when we have room to accommodate it. Pulling is a wilful act. This is different from “pushing” where people tell you what to do do and when to do it, regardless of whether you have capacity for it or if it is really the highest priority task at the time.</p> <h3 id="step-six-reflect"> <a href="#step-six-reflect" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="step-six-reflect"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Step six: reflect </h3> <p>From time to time, reflect on the tasks that have been done:</p> <ul> <li>Which tasks did you do particularly well?</li> <li>Which tasks made you feel good about yourself?</li> <li>Which tasks were difficult to complete?</li> <li>Were the right tasks completed at the right time?</li> <li>Did the tasks completed provide value?</li> </ul> <p>Then ask yourself <em>Why</em>?</p> <p>This is what we call a “retrospective”.</p> <h3 id="kanban-boosters"> <a href="#kanban-boosters" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="kanban-boosters"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Kanban boosters </h3> <p>Every time your personal work involves another person or something happens outside your control, make sure it is reflected on your board.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>A freeway ranges between 0 and 100% capacity; it can be anywhere from totally empty to completely filled with vehicles. But the freeway doesn’t optimise for capacity, it optimises for throughput. Capacity is a spatial relationship, while throughput is a flow relationship.</p> <p>Like traffic, work does not fit. Work flows.</p> <p>When we don’t acknowledge or respect our work’s flow we fall prey to multitasking. We rush through one thing to get next, striving for quantity (productivity) when we know quality (effectiveness) will surely suffer.</p> <p>A 2009 <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/august24/multitask-research-study-082409.html">Stanford University study</a> dispels the myth that multitaskers have mental edge over those who focus on a single task, ultimately deeming multitasking counterproductive. High multitaskers optimise for capacity not for throughput.</p> <p>We want <em>throughput</em>. Throughput is a flowbased system. It measures success by the amount of quality work flowing from READY to DONE over time, not just the volume of work. The rate which work moves from READY to DONE is our throughput.</p> <blockquote> <h3 id="in-four-years-ill-send-julie-to-university"> <a href="#in-four-years-ill-send-julie-to-university" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="in-four-years-ill-send-julie-to-university"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> In four years I’ll send Julie to university </h3> <p>How? Personally and professionally, we often get stuck in “analysis paralysis”.

He takes those sticky notes and populates his READY column with them. In his brain immediately understands hat progress is being made towards his goal.

The more a system relies to force action, the less sustainable it becomes.</p> <p>Push systems tend to cause bottlenecks by ignoring natural capacity. Work is released downstream whether or not the worker has the capacity to process it. Capacity problems are discovered after the fact, works begins to pile up and, as it grows, can easily escalate into an emergency.</p> <p>In a pull system people take work only when they have the capacity to do so.</p> <p>Pushing tends to be a blind act; the initiator has little idea of the terrain situated before him.</p> <p>Pulling is a rational act. The initiator is familiar with the terrain that lies ahead, and can gauge the amount of room in which to manoeuvre.</p> <p>When you reach into your backlog and pull a task READY into DOING, you’re making a conscious choice based on the room you have in your WIP.</p> <p><strong>Pull when you can, be pushed when you must.</strong></p> <h2 id="components-of-a-quality-life"> <a href="#components-of-a-quality-life" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="components-of-a-quality-life"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Components of a quality life </h2> <h3 id="metacognition-a-cure-for-the-common-wisdom"> <a href="#metacognition-a-cure-for-the-common-wisdom" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="metacognition-a-cure-for-the-common-wisdom"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Metacognition: a cure for the common wisdom </h3> <p><strong>We obsess over getting <em>stuff</em> done, rather than getting the <em>right stuff</em> done, and at the <em>right time</em>.

Deadlines are a proxy for clarity.</p> <h3 id="smaller-faster-better-controlling-task-size-and-limiting-wip"> <a href="#smaller-faster-better-controlling-task-size-and-limiting-wip" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="smaller-faster-better-controlling-task-size-and-limiting-wip"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Smaller, faster, better: controlling task size and limiting WIP </h3> <p>Making tasks smaller isn’t enough.

Drilling down the heart of the matter exposes an actionable reason for the event.</li> <li><strong>The Socratic Method</strong>: You question your own assumptions, stripping away confounding information to reveal the truth embedded in your position.
