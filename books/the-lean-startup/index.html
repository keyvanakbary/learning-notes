It’s the boring stuff that matters the most</p> </blockquote> <p>Startup success can be engineered by following the right process, which means it can be learned, which means it can be taught. We do everything wrong: instead of spending years perfecting our technology, we build a minimum viable product, an early product that is terrible, full of bugs and crash-your-computer-yes-really stability problems. Then we ship it to customers way before it’s ready. And we charge money for it.</p> <blockquote> <p>I kept having the experience of working incredibly hard on products that ultimately failed in the marketplace. At first, largely because of my background, I viewed these as technical problems that required technical solutions: better architecture, a better engineering process, better discipline, focus, or product vision</p> </blockquote> <p>The business and marketing functions of a startup should be considered as important as engineering and product development and therefore deserve an equally rigorous methodology to guide them.</p> <h3 id="five-principles-of-lean-startup"> <a href="#five-principles-of-lean-startup" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="five-principles-of-lean-startup"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Five principles of Lean Startup </h3> <ol> <li><strong>Entrepreneurs are everywhere</strong> and the Lean Startup approach can work in any size company, even a very large enterprise, in any sector or industry</li> <li><strong>Entrepreneurship is management</strong>. “entrepreneur” should be considered a job title in all modern companies that depend on innovation for their future growth.</li> <li><strong>Validated learning</strong>. Startups exist to learn how to build a sustainable business. This learning can be validated scientifically by running frequent experiments that allow entrepreneurs to test each element of their vision.</li> <li><strong>Build-Measure-Learn</strong>. Turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere</li> <li><strong>Innovation accounting</strong>. We need focus on the boring stuff: how to measure progress, how to set up milestones, and how to prioritize work</li> </ol> <h3 id="why-startups-fail"> <a href="#why-startups-fail" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="why-startups-fail"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Why startups fail? </h3> <p>Planning and forecasting are only accurate when based on a long, stable operating history and a relatively static environment. Startups have neither.</p> <h2 id="lean-startup-method"> <a href="#lean-startup-method" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="lean-startup-method"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Lean Startup method </h2> <p>Many entrepreneurs take a “just do it” attitude, avoiding all forms of management, process, and discipline. Unfortunately, this approach leads to chaos more often than it does to success.</p> <p>Progress in manufacturing is measured by the production of high-quality physical goods. As we’ll see in Chapter 3, the Lean Startup uses a different unit of progress, called <strong>validated learning</strong>.</p> <p>Consider the recommendation that you build cross-functional teams and hold them accountable to what we call learning milestones instead of organizing your company into strict functional departments (marketing, sales, information technology, human resources, etc.) that hold people accountable for performing well in their specialized areas.</p> <p>When people are used to evaluating their productivity locally, they feel that a good day is one in which they did their job well all day. When I worked as a programmer, that meant eight straight hours of programming without interruption. That was a good day. In contrast, if I was interrupted with questions, process, or—heaven forbid—meetings, I felt bad</p> <blockquote> <p>Code and product features were tangible to me. Learning, by contrast, is frustratingly intangible.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build—the thing customers want and will pay for—as quickly as possible</strong>. Every new version of a product, every new feature, and every new marketing program is an attempt to improve this engine of growth</p> <h3 id="lean-startup"> <a href="#lean-startup" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="lean-startup"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Lean Startup </h3> <p>Instead of making complex plans that are based on a lot of assumptions, you can make constant adjustments with a steering wheel called the <strong>Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop</strong>. Startups also have a true north, a destination in mind: creating a thriving and world-changing business. I call that a startup’s vision. Startups employ a strategy, which includes a business model, a product road map, a point of view about partners and competitors, and ideas about who the customer will be. The product is the end result of this strategy. Less frequently, the strategy may have to change (called a pivot). However, the overarching vision rarely changes. Entrepreneurs are committed to seeing the startup through to that destination.</p> <h2 id="define"> <a href="#define" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="define"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Define </h2> <p>Entrepreneurial prerequisites: proper team structure, good personnel, a strong vision for the future and an appetite for risk taking.</p> <blockquote> <p>A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of <strong>extreme uncertainty</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Take a note that it does not say anything about the size of the company. Anything customers experience from their interaction with a company should be considered part of that company’s product.</p> <p><em>Clayton Christensten The Innovator’s Dilemma</em>: Companies very good at incremental improvements to existing products and serving customers (<em>sustaining innovation</em>), but struggle to create breakthrough new products (<em>disruptive innovation</em>) that can create new sustainable sources of growth.</p> <p>Innovation is a bottoms-up, decentralized, and unpredictable thing. It does not mean it cannot be managed. Cultivating entrepreneurship is the responsibility of senior management. Leadership requires creating conditions that enable employees to do the kinds of experimentation that entrepreneurship requires.</p> <h2 id="learn"> <a href="#learn" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="learn"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Learn </h2> <p>As an engineer or manager, people are accustomed to measure progress by making sure work proceeded according to the plan, it is high quality and cost fits projections. As an entrepreneur, this might not be the best way of measuring progress. <strong>What if we found ourselves building something that nobody wants?</strong></p> <p>If the fundamental goal of entrepreneurship is to engage in organization building under conditions of extreme uncertainty, its most vital function is learning. We must learn what customers really want, not what they say they want or what we think they should want.</p> <p>Validated-learning is not after-the-fact rationalization or a good story designed to hide failure. It’s a rigorous method for demonstrating progress. It’s a way of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup’s present and future business prospects.</p> <p>The question is not “Can this product be built?” but more like “Should this product be built?” or “Can we build a sustainable business around this set of products and services?”. <strong>Everything a startup does is understood to be an experiment designed to achieve validated learning.</strong></p> <h2 id="experiment"> <a href="#experiment" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="experiment"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Experiment </h2> <p><strong>If the plan is to see what happens, a team is guaranteed to succeed – at seeing what happens – but won’t necessarily gain validated learning</strong>. If you cannot fail, you cannot learn. A true experiment follows the scientific method. It begins with clear hypothesis that makes predictions and it then tests predictions empirically. Startup experimentation is guided by startup’s vision. The goal of startups is to discover how to build a sustainable business around that vision.</p> <p>The two most important assumptions entrepreneurs make are:</p> <ul> <li>The <em>value hypothesis</em> tests whether a product or service really delivers value to customers. Experiments provide a more accurate gauge.</li> <li>The <em>growth hypothesis</em> tests how new customers will discover a product or service. The point is not to find the average customer but to find <em>early adopters</em>. Those customers tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and are especially eager to give feedback.</li> </ul> <h3 id="an-experiment-is-a-product"> <a href="#an-experiment-is-a-product" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="an-experiment-is-a-product"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> An experiment is a product </h3> <p>Good questions for the team to answer why developing product:</p> <ul> <li>Do consumers recognise that they have the problem you are trying to solve?</li> <li>If there was a solution, would they buy it?</li> <li>Would they buy it from us?</li> <li>Can we build a solution for that problem?</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p><strong>Success is not delivering a feature; success is learning how to solve the customer’s problem.</strong></p> </blockquote> <h1 id="how-vision-leads-to-steering"> <a href="#how-vision-leads-to-steering" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="how-vision-leads-to-steering"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> How vision leads to steering </h1> <ul> <li><strong>Qualitative feedback</strong>: What customers like and don’t like.</li> <li><strong>Quantiative feedback</strong>: How many customers use the product and find it valuable.</li> </ul> <p>The riskiest elements of a startup’s plan are the <em>leap-of-faith</em> assumptions. The two most important ones are the <strong>value hypothesis</strong> and the <strong>growth hypothesis</strong>. Once clear on these leap-of-faith assumptions the first step is to enter the Build phase as quickly as possible with a minimum viable product (MVP).</p> <p><strong>MVP</strong>: Is the version of the product that enables a full turn of the <em>Build-Measure-Learn</em> loop with the minimum amount of effort and the least amount of development time. Lacks many features that may prove essential later on. <strong>We must be able to measure its impact</strong>. We also need to get in front of potential customers to gauge their reactions.</p> <p>The biggest challenge once we get into the <em>Measure</em> phase is determining if the product development efforts are leading to real progress. We do this by a method called <em><strong>innovation accounting</strong></em>.</p> <p>Innovation accounting is a quantitative approach that allow us to create <em>learning milestones</em> instead of the traditional business and product milestones.</p> <p>Upon completing the <em>Build-Measure-Learn</em> loop we confront the most difficult question any entrepreneur faces: whether to <strong>pivot</strong> the original strategy or persevere.</p> <p><strong>Planning works in the reverse order: we figure out what we need to learn, use innovation accounting to figure out what we need to measure to know if we are gaining validated learning, and then figure out what product we need to build to run that experiment and get that measurement</strong>.</p> <h2 id="leap"> <a href="#leap" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="leap"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Leap </h2> <h3 id="strategy-is-based-on-assumptions"> <a href="#strategy-is-based-on-assumptions" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="strategy-is-based-on-assumptions"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Strategy is based on assumptions </h3> <p>Every business plan begins with a set of assumptions. A startup early efforts should be to test them as quickly as possible. The first challenge for an entrepreneur is to build an organization that can test these assumptions systematically. The second challenge is to perform that rigorous testing without losing sight of the company’s overall vision.</p> <p>What differentiates the success stories from the failures is that the successful entrepreneurs had the foresight, the ability, and the tools to discover which part of their plans were working brilliantly and which were misguided, and adapt their strategies accordingly.</p> <h3 id="growth"> <a href="#growth" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="growth"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Growth </h3> <p>The first step in understanding a new product or service is to figure out if it is fundamentally value-creating or value-destroying.</p> <p>It’s essential that entrepreneurs understand the reasons behind a startup’s growth. There are many value-destroying kinds of growth that should be avoided (a business that grows through continuos fund-raising from investors and lots of paid advertising but does not develop a value-creating product).</p> <h3 id="design-and-customer-archetype"> <a href="#design-and-customer-archetype" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="design-and-customer-archetype"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Design and customer archetype </h3> <p>The goal of the early contact with customers is not to gain definitive answers but to clarify at a basic level that we understand our potential customer and what problems they have. <strong>The archetype is a brief document that represents a target customer and serves as a guide for product development.</strong> An archetype is an hypothesis, not a fact.</p> <h3 id="analysis-paralysis"> <a href="#analysis-paralysis" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="analysis-paralysis"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Analysis paralysis </h3> <p>There are two ever-present dangers:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Just-do-it</strong> school of entrepreneurship are impatient to get started and don’t want to spend time analyzing their strategy.</li> <li>Others fall victim to <strong>analysis paralysis</strong>, talking to customers, reading research reports and whiteboard strategizing are all equally unhelpful.</li> </ul> <p>How do entrepreneurs know when to stop analyzing and start building?

The goal of an MVP is to begin the process of learning, not end it. Unlike a prototype or concept test, an MVP is designed not just to answer a product design or technical questions but to <strong>test fundamental business hypothesis</strong>.</p> <h3 id="first-products-arent-mean-to-be-perfect"> <a href="#first-products-arent-mean-to-be-perfect" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="first-products-arent-mean-to-be-perfect"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> First products aren’t mean to be perfect </h3> <p>Before new products can be sold successfully to the mass market, they have to be sold to early adopters.</p> <h3 id="the-concierge-minimum-viable-product"> <a href="#the-concierge-minimum-viable-product" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-concierge-minimum-viable-product"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The concierge minimum viable product </h3> <p>This is a personal in-home visits and manual works (no software) just to learn as fast as possible.

This does not mean operating in a sloppy or undisciplined way. There is a category of quality problems that have a net effect of slowing down the <em>Build-Measure-Learn</em> feedback loop. Defects make it more difficult to evolve the product. They actually interfere with our ability to learn and so are dangerous to tolerate in any production process. Instead of reducing the quality, reduce the scope: remove any feature process, or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning seek.</p> <h2 id="measure"> <a href="#measure" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="measure"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Measure </h2> <p>A startup job is to:</p> <ol> <li>Rigorously measure where it is right now.</li> <li>Devise experiments to learn how to move the real numbers closer to the ideal reflected in the business plan.</li> </ol> <h3 id="accountability-framework"> <a href="#accountability-framework" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="accountability-framework"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Accountability framework </h3> <p>It begins by turning the leap-of-faith assumptions into quantitative financial model.</p> <p><strong>The rate of growth depends primarily on three things: the profitability of each customer, the cost of acquiring new customers, and the repeat purchase rate of existing customers.</strong></p> <h3 id="three-learning-milestones"> <a href="#three-learning-milestones" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="three-learning-milestones"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Three learning milestones </h3> <p>First, use an MVP to establish real data on where the company is right now.</p> <p>Second, startups must attempt to tune the engine from the baseline towards the ideal.

Then you should attach the seal. Then you should put the stamps.</p> </blockquote> <p>Their father wanted to do it the counterintuitive way: complete each envelope one at a time. They - like most of us - thought that was backward “That wouldn’t be efficient!”</p> <p><strong>Doing it one at a time is faster</strong>. Intuition does not take into account the extra time to sort, stack and move around the large piles of half-complete envelopes when it’s done the other way.</p> <p>In process-oriented work like this, individual performance is not nearly as important as the overall performance of the system.</p> <p>The small-batch approach produces a finished product every few seconds, whereas the large-batch approach must deliver all the product at once, at the end. What if it turns out that the customers have decided they don’t want the product? Which process would allow a company to find this out sooner?</p> <p>Lean manufacturers discovered the benefits of small batches ago. Innovators as Taiichi Ohno, Shigeo Shingo and others found a way to succeed by using small batches. Instead of buying large specialized machines that could produce thousands of parts at a time, Toyota used smaller general-purpose machines that could produce a wide variety of parts in small batches.</p> <p>Because of its smaller batch size, Toyota was able to produce a much greater diversity of products.</p> <p><strong>The biggest benefit of working in small batches is that quality problems can be identified much sooner.</strong> This is the origin of Toyota’s famous <em>andon</em> cord, which allows any worker to ask for help as soon as they notice any problem, such a defect in physical part, stopping the entire production line if it cannot be corrected immediately. It can interrupt the flow as the line is halted repeatedly. The benefits of finding and fixing problems faster outweigh this cost. This process of continuously driving out defects has been a win-win for Toyota and its customers.</p> <h4 id="small-batches-in-entrepreneurship"> <a href="#small-batches-in-entrepreneurship" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="small-batches-in-entrepreneurship"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Small batches in entrepreneurship </h4> <p>In the Lean Startup the goal is not to produce more stuff efficiently but to learn how to build a sustainable business. <strong>as quickly as possible</strong>.</p> <p>Working in small batches ensures that a startup can minimize the expenditure of time, money, and effort that ultimately turns out to have been wasted.</p> <p>Nowadays large batches are still the rule. The work that goes into the development of a new product proceeds on a virtual assembly line. Product managers figure out what features are likely to please customers; product designers then figure out how those features should look and feel. These designs are passed to engineering, which builds something new or modifies an existing product and, once this is done, hands it off to somebody responsible for verifying that the new product works the way the product managers and designers intended</p> <p>Instead of working in separate departments, engineers and designers would work together side by side on one feature at a time.

When you see someone dressed int he latest clothes or driving a certain car, you may be influenced to by that product.</li> <li><strong>Through funded advertising</strong>. As long as the cost of acquiring a new customer (the so-called marginal cost) is less than the revenue of that customer generates (the marginal revenue), the excess (the marginal profit) can be used to acquire more customers. The more marginal profit, the faster growth.</li> <li><strong>Through repeat purchase or use.</strong> Some products are designed to be purchased repeatedly either through a subscription plan or through voluntary repurchases.</li> </ul> <h3 id="the-three-engines-of-growth"> <a href="#the-three-engines-of-growth" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-three-engines-of-growth"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The three engines of growth </h3> <p>There are always a zillion new ideas about how to make the product better floating around, but the hard truth is that most of those ideas make a difference only at the margins. They are mere optimizations.

There is an expectation that once you start using their product, you’ll continue to do so. Companies using the sticky engine of growth track their attrition rate or churn rate very carefully. The churn rate is defined as the fraction of customers in any period who fail to remain engaged with the company’s product. The rules that govern the sticky engine of growth are pretty simple: if the rate of new customer acquisition exceeds the churn rate, the product will grow. The speed of growth is determined by what I call the rate of compounding, which is simple the natural growth rate minus the churn rate. Example: 61% retention rate, 31% growth rate, compounding growth rate of just 0.02%, almost zero.</p> <h4 id="the-viral-engine-of-growth"> <a href="#the-viral-engine-of-growth" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-viral-engine-of-growth"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The viral engine of growth </h4> <p>The viral engine is powered by a feedback loop that can be quantified. It is called the <em>viral loop</em>, and its speed is determined by a single mathematical term called the <em>viral coefficient</em>. The higher this coefficient is, the faster the product will spread. How many friends will each customer bring with him or her? A viral loop with a coefficient that is greater than 1.0 will grow exponentially. Many viral products do not charge customers directly but rely on indirect sources of revenue such as advertising. This is the case because viral products cannot afford to have any friction impede the process of signing customers up and recruiting their friends.</p> <h4 id="the-paid-engine-of-growth"> <a href="#the-paid-engine-of-growth" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-paid-engine-of-growth"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The paid engine of growth </h4> <p>If either company wants to increase its rate of growth, it can do so in one of two ways: increase the revenue from each customer or drive down the cost of acquiring a new customer.</p> <p>The paid engine of growth is powered by a feedback loop. Each customer pays a certain amount of money for the product over his or her “lifetime” as a customer. Once variable costs are deducted, this usually is called customer <em>lifetime value</em> (LTV). This revenue can be invested in growth by buying advertising.</p> <p>Example: If the CPA remains at $2 but the LTV falls bellow $2, the company’s growth will slow down. It may make up the difference with one-time tactics such as using invested capital or publicity stunts, but those tactics are not sustainable.</p> <h3 id="technical-caveat"> <a href="#technical-caveat" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="technical-caveat"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Technical caveat </h3> <p>More than one engine of growth can operate in a business at a time. It’s strongly recommended to focus one engine at a time.
