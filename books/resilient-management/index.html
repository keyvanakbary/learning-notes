<p>A team is composed of a least two people who share the same strategic objective.</p> <p>Glossary:</p> <ul> <li>Teammates: People you’re responsible as a manager.</li> <li>Discipline: The skill set you primarily use at work. Peg: Design, or Brand Design.</li> <li>Functional team: People who work on the same discipline.</li> <li>Feature (Product) team: People from different disciplines who work together on a specific feature or product.</li> </ul> <p>Sometimes, a team might be described as both functional team <em>and</em> feature team, peg: Mobile Platform team.</p> <p>As a manager, you must be able to assess and improve your team’s dynamic.</p> <p>Tuckman’s stages of group development:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Forming</strong>, when the group comes together. It might have a name and some understanding of tis goal, but processes and patterns still need to be defined.</li> <li><strong>Storming</strong>, you’ll start to see some friction. You’ve gotta feel some confusion and clashing to make it to the next stage.</li> <li><strong>Norming</strong>, where things start to iron themselves out. Individuals resolve their differences, and clarity is introduced.</li> <li><strong>Performing</strong>, flow state. You’re effective, you are communicating well, and you’re shipping.</li> </ol> <p>When a person joins, or a manager changes, or the mission changes, these stages of group development can restart.</p> <h2 id="meet-your-team"> <a href="#meet-your-team" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="meet-your-team"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Meet your team </h2> <p>One of your primary jobs is to foster a foundation of trust on your team. To foster trust, you’ve gotta start by understanding each other.</p> <p>To get to know your teammates as individuals, start from a place of genuine curiosity and authenticity.</p> <p>Paloma Medina research indicates that humans have six core needs (<em>BICEPS</em>). Needs that must be met in order for us to feel safe and secure.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Belonging</strong>, a connection to a community or to a group of people. When you feel rejected or left out from a group, you’ll feel threatened.</li> <li><strong>Improvement/progress</strong>, A sense of making progress, whether for your organisation, your team, or your personal life. People may feel frustrated when their work doesn’t affect the greater good, or when there are no enough challenges, or when they change from the maker path to the manager path.</li> <li><strong>Choice (or autonomy)</strong>, the power to make decisions about your own life and work. This needs calls for balance, too many choices can feel overwhelming; too few choices can make you feel powerless.</li> <li><strong>Equality/fairness</strong>, the idea that your environment includes equal access to resources, information, and support for everyone in it. When this doesn’t happen (or there’s a perception that doesn’t happen), people take to the streets and revolt.</li> <li><strong>Predictability</strong>, requires balancing too. If change is the only constant, it can be exhausting. If there are <em>never</em> any surprises, it gets boring. When our sense of certainty is threatened, we may have a <em>really</em> hard time focusing.</li> <li><strong>Significance</strong>, or status. Understanding where we are in a hierarchy, especially in relation to others. How do we get recognised also plays into it.</li> </ul> <p>Each person might care about some particular code needs more than others.</p> <p>Often we project our <em>own</em> core needs onto someone else, which means you’ll likely be trying to help them have their needs met while not quite addressing the <em>core</em> of their core-need problem.</p> <h3 id="work-style-and-preferences"> <a href="#work-style-and-preferences" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="work-style-and-preferences"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Work style and preferences </h3> <p>It can be really helpful to gather insights about each teammate’s growth areas, preferences about feedback and recognition, and other aspects of their work.</p> <p>You can ask a list of simple questions to your teammates in your first 1:1 together. A template.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>What makes you grumpy?

How will I know when you're grumpy?

How can I help you when you're grumpy?

In what medium (Slack, email, in person, etc.) do you prefer to receive feedback?

When do you prefer to receive feedback—routinely in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?

How do you prefer to receive recognition—publicly or privately?

What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

What are your goals for this year? And for the next three months?

What do you need from your manager?

What do you need from your teammates?

What do you need from your peers outside the team?

Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?

What's your favourite way to treat yourself?

I asked open questions and offered reflections much more than I issued directives. Direct reports who wanted more direction grew frustrated.</p> </blockquote> <p>Think about the scenarios in which your particular management approach might manifest day to day, such when you are:</p> <ul> <li>Coaching, mentoring, or sponsoring your reports</li> <li>Requesting and delivering feedback</li> <li>Goal setting or vision setting for/with your team</li> <li>Scoping, delegating, and shipping work for/with your team</li> <li>Communicating to/with your teammates in different mediums</li> </ul> <p>In those environments, what do you find you <em>optimise</em> for most as a manager?</p><hr /> <p>Optimise for long-term relationships.</p> <p>In the beginning of your relationships, share with your teammates:</p> <ul> <li>What do you optimise for in your role?</li> <li>What do you hope your teammates will lean on you for?</li> <li>What management skill are you currently working on learning or improving?</li> </ul> <p>Sharing the <em>one thing</em> that you want to make sure your teammates know about you, so that they aren’t mystified day to day.</p> <h2 id="grow-your-teammates"> <a href="#grow-your-teammates" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="grow-your-teammates"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Grow your teammates </h2> <p>This is the Storming stage. Previously, each person had been doing their own thing asn individuals, now a few things need to be ironed out: how to collaborate, how to hit goals, how to determine priorities. There will be friction.</p> <p>You’ll end up wearing four different hats: Mentoring, coaching, sponsoring and delivering feedback.</p> <h3 id="mentoring"> <a href="#mentoring" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="mentoring"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Mentoring </h3> <p>In mentoring mode, we’re giving out advice, sharing our experience and perspective, and helping someone else problem based on that information.</p> <p>If you are not a member of a marginalised group, and you have a mentee who <em>is</em>, be aware of the way members of underrepresented groups are perceived. Make sure that your advice is going to be helpful in practice for your mentee.</p> <p>Our mentee success is ultimately <em>our</em> success.</p> <p>Managers often default to mentoring mode because it feels lke the fastest way to solve a problem, but it falls short in helping your teammate connect their <em>own</em> dots.</p> <h3 id="coaching"> <a href="#coaching" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="coaching"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Coaching </h3> <p>In mentoring mode, you’re focused on both the problem and the solution. While coaching, you’ll be asking open questions and reflecting upon them.</p> <h4 id="asking-open-questions"> <a href="#asking-open-questions" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="asking-open-questions"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Asking open questions </h4> <p>To explore more of the shape of the topic, rather than staying at the surface level.</p> <p>The best questions are about the problem, not the solution. Questions that start with <em>why</em> tend to make the other person feel judged, questions that start with <em>how</em> tend to go into problem solving mode, bot we should be avoided. <em>What</em> questions can be authentically curious.</p> <ul> <li><em>What’s most important to you about it?</em></li> <li><em>What’s holding you back?</em></li> <li><em>What does success look like?</em></li> </ul> <p>Coaching would start a two-way conversation, which would help make an otherwise tricky conversation feel more like a shared exploration.</p> <p>Open questions, asked from a place of genuine curiosity, help people feel seen and heard.</p> <p>Forming lots of open questions (instead of problem solving questions, or giving advice) is tremendously hard, but totally worth it.</p> <h4 id="reflecting"> <a href="#reflecting" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="reflecting"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Reflecting </h4> <p>Holding up a mirror for the other person and describing what you see or hear, or asking them to reflect themselves.</p> <p>Help your teammates reflect by repeating back to them what you hear them say.</p> <ul> <li><em>What I’m hearing you say is that you’re frustrated with how this project is going. Is that right?</em></li> </ul> <p>Don’t be worried about giving a bad reflection; reflecting back what you’re hearing will still help your teammate.</p> <p>Sometimes the act of reflection forces the other person to do some <em>introspection</em> an realise new aspects of the problem.</p> <p>When coaching, you don’t need to have all the answers, you’re just there as a mirror and as a question-asker, to help the other person to think deeply and come to some new, interesting conclusions. It may not feel all that effective but coaching can generate <em>way more growth</em> than giving them advice or sharing your perspective.</p> <h3 id="sponsoring"> <a href="#sponsoring" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="sponsoring"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Sponsoring </h3> <p>The sponsor hat is more often worn when they’re <em>not</em> around.</p> <p>Sponsorship is all about feeling <em>on the hook</em> for getting someone to the next level. You will put your personal reputation on the line on behalf of the person you’re sponsoring.</p> <ul> <li>Giving visible/public recognition</li> <li>Assigning stretch tasks and projects that are <em>just beyond</em> their current skill set, to help them grow and gather evidence for future promotion</li> <li>Opening the door for them to write blog posts, give company or conference talks, or contribute open-source work.</li> </ul> <p>Members of underrepresented groups are typically over-mentored, but under-sponsored (<em>in-group bias</em>).</p> <p>Put in the time and intention to ensure that you’re sponsoring members of underrepresented groups too.</p> <h3 id="constructing-and-delivering-feedback"> <a href="#constructing-and-delivering-feedback" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="constructing-and-delivering-feedback"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Constructing and delivering feedback </h3> <p>It’s important to routinely deliver both positive and negative feedback to your teammates about their performance within their role.</p> <p>You’ll want to look for opportunities to help your teammates grow or work better together by giving them feedback.</p> <p>The best feedback is specific, actionable, and delivered in a way that ensures the receiver can actually absorb it.</p> <p>The feedback equation:</p> <p><strong>Observation</strong> of behaviour + <strong>Impact</strong> of behaviour + <strong>Request</strong> or <strong>Question</strong> = Specific, actionable feedback</p> <ul> <li><strong>Observation</strong>, describe the simple facts of what happened, the who/what/when/where part of the feedback.</li> <li><strong>Impact</strong>, <em>this</em> is where you can share how you feel. Share the effects of the behaviour you’re seeing. The impact is often personal. Framing the impact in terms of what the recipient cares about will more quickly motivate them to change their behaviour.</li> <li><strong>Request or question</strong>, if you’re always defaulting to making a request, the other person doesn’t have to do much thinking or problem solving on their own. Hit pause on the mentoring mode and go into coaching mode instead. Asking an open question at the end of delivering feedback is often much more powerful than making a request.</li> </ul> <h4 id="coaching-teammates-to-deliver-feedback"> <a href="#coaching-teammates-to-deliver-feedback" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="coaching-teammates-to-deliver-feedback"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Coaching teammates to deliver feedback </h4> <p>Feedback is <em>really</em> hard to deliver when you don’t personally own it. Feedback is also much more impactful and easy to understand when receiving it directly from the person who has it.</p> <p>The first step <em>usually</em> should be taken by the person who has the feedback to share.</p> <p>Start by coaching your teammate, what they might want the outcome to be, and what they want to optimise for as they have the conversation.</p> <p>Then, in mentoring mode, walk them through the feedback equation and help them craft some good words and phrases for each of the three parts. Facts without judgement.</p> <p>If there’s no impact, then likely it is not feedback. Coach the teammate who wants to give the feedback to introspect and develop a new perspective on it.</p> <p>If there <em>is</em> feedback to be given, mentor and coach your teammate to develop a solid set of questions, to be more of a conversation.</p> <p>If you ever find yourself needing to deliver feedback as a third party, find an aspect of the feedback that you can personally own. Care about team trust and psychological safety.</p> <p>If you want your teammates to get into the habit of giving feedback, encourage them to align it to their career goals.</p> <h3 id="striking-a-balance"> <a href="#striking-a-balance" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="striking-a-balance"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Striking a balance </h3> <p>Managers and individuals often aim to accomplish the following in their 1:1s</p> <ol> <li><strong>Build trust</strong>. A manager wants to develop a relationship and get to know their report so they can best support them. A teammate wants to know if their manager cares about them and is invested in their success.</li> <li><strong>Gain shared context</strong>. A manager wants to disseminate clear, relevant information about day-to-day work and company goals. A teammate wants to hear rumours, news and higher-level strategy.</li> <li><strong>Plan out and support career growth</strong>. A manager wants to help their teammate identify goals and plan their career trajectory. A teammate wants to keep growing their skills, gain new opportunities, and get feedback on their blind spots.</li> <li><strong>Solve problems</strong>. A manager wants to hear about blockers and other challenges so that they can help their teammates get unblocked. A teammate wants advice, mentorship, and assistance in making progress on their projects.</li> </ol> <p>Open questions and reflections (coach) do so much more for building trust and helping someone grow than mentoring activities do. Sponsoring is great for growth <em>and</em> for building trust. If a teammate needs a bit more direction, mentoring is great. Feedback is the icing on the cake.</p> <p>Once you’ve build a foundation of trust, be open to feedback about which skills you should practice more.</p> <p>Sometimes the other person won’t fully understand feedback, it won’t take it seriously, or won’t be able to change.</p> <p>Consider whether or not this teammate might flourish if they moved ot a different part of the organisation.</p> <p>When someone’s behaviour is damaging to those around them, talk with another leader in the organisation about what to do. It’s possible that there’s another way you could be approaching this person to help them see how serious the situation is, and what needs to change; it’s also possible that it’s time for them to go. Lean on your network of support, you don’t need to do this alone.</p> <h2 id="set-clear-expectations"> <a href="#set-clear-expectations" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="set-clear-expectations"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Set clear expectations </h2> <p>Develop clear expectations in <em>collaboration</em> with your team, document them in a searchable, central location, and keep them updated over time. Team-wide expectations that are worth documenting and iterating:</p> <ul> <li>Teammates’ roles and responsibilities, including the manager’s role</li> <li>The team mission or priorities</li> <li>How teammates should be collaborating, communicating, and shipping work</li> </ul> <h3 id="roles-and-responsibilities"> <a href="#roles-and-responsibilities" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="roles-and-responsibilities"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Roles and responsibilities </h3> <p>Clarity typically comes in the form of documentation like a career ladder.</p> <p>Individual’s day-to-day or project-specific responsibilities can feel ambiguous.

If you need to disagree publicly, make sure you phrase it in a way that won’t sow seeds of disgruntlement and uncertainty with others.</p> <p>Whenever possible, add steps in your communications plan explicitly designed to collect feedback, to make people feel seen and heard as they learn about this new information.</p> <h3 id="choosing-your-medium"> <a href="#choosing-your-medium" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="choosing-your-medium"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Choosing your medium </h3> <p>Your go-to communication style, cadence, and channels depend on what’s typical for your company culture, as well as what feels right for your message.</p> <h4 id="meetings"> <a href="#meetings" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="meetings"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Meetings </h4> <p>Meetings are there for you to both <em>push</em> information and <em>pull</em> information, especially when that information requires additional context.</p> <p>Sensitive, difficult, or surprise information is best communicated in person first (and followed up with an email).

You’ll have to repeat it several times until it gets assimilated.</p> <p>You’ll find also that particular word choices land better with different audiences, or different mediums get more feedback or attention from others. There is another element to think about: your energy as you’re communicating.</p> <p>There is a range of styles for communicating the same message. For example, you can use colours, so you are aware of different styles available for your toolbox</p> <ul> <li><strong>Red</strong>, a bit of anger, frustration, edge, or urgency.</li> <li><strong>Orange</strong>, cautious, hesitant, tiptoes around topics</li> <li><strong>Yellow</strong>, lighthearted, effervescent, crack jokes</li> <li><strong>Green</strong>, in tune with other’s feelings, loving, high emotional intelligence</li> <li><strong>Blue</strong>, calm, cool, collected, steady</li> <li><strong>Purple</strong>, creative, flowy, great at storytelling</li> <li><strong>Brown</strong>, adds (and lives in) nuance, complexity, or ambiguity</li> <li><strong>Black</strong>, blunt, unfeeling, no nuance, cut and dry</li> </ul> <p>Sometimes people need to hear a different tone, or feel a different energy. Strong leaders understand the spectrum of communication styles.</p> <p>We also tend to assume that everyone understand, prioritises, and cares about the same things we care about, but that’s not often the case. Do the leg work of listening and learning what others around you are motivated by, are optimising for, and are prioritising. Then translate your message into something that’s more digestible and easy for that audience to care about.</p> <p>Just like your communication style and cadence will evolve over time, your organisation’s will, too. As the company grows, as the vision pivots or becomes better articulated, as people leave and new people are hired, how and what they communicate will necessarily evolve too.</p> <h2 id="build-resiliency"> <a href="#build-resiliency" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="build-resiliency"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Build resiliency </h2> <p>Every organisation-wide action ripples out to both teammates and managers.
