Don’t try </h2> <blockquote> <p>The real story of Bukowski’s success: his comfort with himself as a failure. Bukowski didn’t give a fuck about success.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fixation on the positive only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not. <strong>No truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she’s happy.</strong></p> <p>If you’re dreaming of something all the time, then you’re reinforcing the same unconscious reality over and over: that you are <em>not that</em>.</p> <p>Giving a fuck about more stuff is good for business. Giving too many fucks is bad for your mental health. It causes you to become overly attached to the superficial and fake. <strong>The key to a good life is not giving a fuck, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.</strong></p> <h3 id="the-feedback-loop-from-hell"> <a href="#the-feedback-loop-from-hell" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-feedback-loop-from-hell"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The feedback loop from hell </h3> <p>We feel bad about feeling bad. We feel guilty of feeling guilty. We get angry about getting angry. We get anxious about feeling anxious. Not giving a fuck is key, to accept that the world is totally fucked and that’s all right, because it’s always been that way and always will be.</p> <p><em><strong>Wanting a positive experience is a negative experience; accepting negative experience is a positive experience</strong></em></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>You’ll never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of.</strong> – Albert Camus</p> </blockquote> <p>Everything in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires.</p> <p>How to pick and choose what matters to you and what does not matter to you is based on finely honed personal values.</p> <h3 id="the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fuck"> <a href="#the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fuck" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fuck"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The subtle art of not giving a fuck </h3> <p><strong>Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.</strong></p> <p>Indifferent people are afraid of the world and the repercussions of their own choices. That’s why they don’t make any meaningful choices. <strong>You must give a fuck about something</strong>.</p> <p>“Fuck it,” not to everything in life, but rather to everything <em>unimportant</em> to life. They reserve their fucks for what truly matters. Friends. Family. Purpose. People give a fuck about them in return.</p> <p><strong>To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.</strong></p> <p>The problem with people who hand out fucks like ice cream at a goddamn summer camp is that they don’t have anything more fuck-worthy to dedicate their fucks to. If a person has no problems. the mind automatically finds a way to invent some.</p> <p>If you don’t find that meaningful something, your fucks will be given to meaningless and frivolous causes.</p> <p><strong>Whether you realise it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.</strong></p> <p>Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy. Basically: our families, our best friends and our golf swing.</p> <h3 id="so-mark-what-the-fuck-is-the-point-of-this-book-anyway"> <a href="#so-mark-what-the-fuck-is-the-point-of-this-book-anyway" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="so-mark-what-the-fuck-is-the-point-of-this-book-anyway"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> So Mark, what the fuck is the point of this book anyway? </h3> <p>When we believe that it’s not okay for things to suck sometimes, then we unconsciously start blaming ourselves.</p> <p><strong>Practical enlightenment is becoming comfortable with the idea that some suffering is always inevitable.</strong> The only way to overcome pain is to first learn how to bear it.</p> <h2 id="happiness-is-a-problem"> <a href="#happiness-is-a-problem" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="happiness-is-a-problem"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Happiness is a problem </h2> <p><strong>As with being rich, there is no value in suffering when it’s done without purpose.</strong></p> <p>Pain and loss are inevitable and we should let go of trying to resist them.</p> <h3 id="the-misadventures-of-disappointment-panda"> <a href="#the-misadventures-of-disappointment-panda" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-misadventures-of-disappointment-panda"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The misadventures of disappointment panda </h3> <p>The greatest truths in life are usually the most unpleasant to hear.</p> <p>We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature’s preferred agent for inspiring change.</p> <p>This constant dissatisfaction has kept our species fighting and striving, building and conquering. So no, our own pain and misery aren’t a bug of human evolution; they’re a feature.</p> <p>Pain is what teaches us what to pay attention. Our psychological pain is not necessarily always bad or even undesirable.</p> <p>And this is what’s so dangerous about a society that coddles itself more and more from the inevitable discomforts of life: we lose the benefits of experiencing healthy doses of pain, a loss that disconnects us from reality of the world around us.</p> <h3 id="happiness-comes-from-solving-problems"> <a href="#happiness-comes-from-solving-problems" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="happiness-comes-from-solving-problems"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Happiness comes from solving problems </h3> <p>To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is therefore a form of action.</p> <p>Happiness is a constant work-in-progress, because solving problems is a constant work-in-progress. The solutions to today’s problems will lay the foundation for tomorrow’s problems.</p> <p>For many people, life doesn’t feel that simple:</p> <ol> <li><em>Denial</em>. Some people deny that their problems exist, they must constantly delude or distract themselves from reality.</li> <li><em>Victim Mentality</em>. Some choose to believe that there is nothing they can do to solve their problems.</li> </ol> <p>People deny and blame others for their problems for the simple reason that it’s easy and feels good, while solving problems is hard and often feels bad.</p> <p>Remember, nobody who is actually happy has to stand in front of a mirror and tell himself that he’s happy.</p> <h3 id="emotions-are-overrated"> <a href="#emotions-are-overrated" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="emotions-are-overrated"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Emotions are overrated </h3> <p>Negative emotions are a <em>call to action</em>. When you feel them, it’s because you’re supposed to <em>do something</em>. Positive emotions, on the other hand, are rewards for taking the proper action.</p> <p>Emotions are merely signposts, <em>suggestions</em>, not commandments. We should make a habit of questioning them.</p> <p>To deny one’s negative emotions is to deny the feedback mechanisms that help a person solve problems.</p> <p>Decision-making based on emotional, pretty much always sucks.</p> <p>Whatever makes us happy today will no longer make us happy tomorrow, because our biology always needs something more.</p> <p>Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice. What creates our positive experiences will define our negative experiences.</p> <h3 id="choose-your-struggle"> <a href="#choose-your-struggle" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="choose-your-struggle"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Choose your struggle </h3> <p>Lifelong fulfilment and meaning have to be earned through the choosing and managing of our struggles. You can’t win if you don’t play.</p> <p>What determines your success isn’t “What do you want to enjoy?” <strong>The relevant question is “What pain do you want to sustain?” The path to happiness is a full path of shitheaps and shame.</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>The truth is, I thought I wanted something (become a rockstar), but it turns out I didn’t. End of story.</p> <p>I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory.</p> </blockquote> <p>Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. Our struggles determine our successes. If you think at any point you’re allowed to stop climbing, I’m afraid you’re missing the point. Because the joy is in the climb itself.</p> <h2 id="you-are-not-special"> <a href="#you-are-not-special" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="you-are-not-special"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> You are not special </h2> <p>Sometime in the 1960s, developing “high self-esteem”, having positive thoughts and feelings about oneself, became all the rage in psychology. People who <em>thought</em> highly about themselves generally performed better and caused fewer problems. Many researchers and policymakers at the time came to believe that raising a population’s self-esteem could lead to some tangible social benefits.</p> <p>The paradoxical mantra: every single one of us can be exceptional and massively successful.</p> <p>A generation later and the data is in: we’re <em>not</em> all exceptional. Feeling good about yourself doesn’t mean anything unless you have a <em>good reason</em> to feel good about yourself. <strong>Adversity and failure are actually useful and even necessary for developing strong-minded and successful adults.</strong> Teaching people to believe they’re exceptional and to feel good about themselves no matter what leads to a population full of Jimmys.</p> <p>Jimmy, the delusional start-up founder. The Jimmy who spent so much talking about how good he was that he forgot to, you know, actually do something.</p> <p>People who feel entitled view every occurrence in their life as either an affirmation of, or a threat to, their own greatness.</p> <p>The true measurement of self-worth is not how a person feels about her <em>positive</em> experiences, but rather how she feels about her <em>negative</em> experiences.</p> <p>Entitled people, incapable of acknowledging their own problems openly and honestly, are incapable of improving their lives in any lasting or meaningful way.</p> <h3 id="things-fall-apart"> <a href="#things-fall-apart" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="things-fall-apart"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Things fall apart </h3> <blockquote> <p>The pain from my adolescence led me down a road of entitlement that lasted through much of my early adulthood. I was worthy. I felt entitled to say or do whatever I wanted, to break peoples trust, to ignore people’s feelings, and then justify it later with shitty, half-assed apologies.</p> </blockquote> <p>The deeper the pain, the more helpless we feel against our problems, and the more entitlement we adopt to compensate those problems.</p> <ol> <li>I’m awesome and the rest of you all suck, so I deserve special treatment.</li> <li>I suck and the rest of you are all awesome, so I deserve special treatment.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Construing everything in life so as to make yourself out to be constantly victimised requires just as much selfishness as the opposite.</strong></p> <p>There is no such thing as a personal problem. Other people have had it in the past, have it now, and are going to have it in the future. <strong>You are not special.</strong></p> <p>The easier and more problem-free our lives become, the more we seem to feel entitled for them to get even better.</p> <h3 id="the-tyranny-of-exceptionalism"> <a href="#the-tyranny-of-exceptionalism" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-tyranny-of-exceptionalism"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The tyranny of exceptionalism </h3> <p>We’re all, for the most part, pretty average people. There’s no way we can process the tidal waves of information flowing past us constantly. The pieces that break through and catch our attention are the truly exceptional.</p> <p>The inundation of the exceptional makes people feel worse about themselves, makes them feel that they need to be more extreme, more radical, and more self-assured to get noticed or even matter.</p> <h3 id="b-b-b-but-if-im-not-going-to-be-special-or-extraordinary-whats-the-point"> <a href="#b-b-b-but-if-im-not-going-to-be-special-or-extraordinary-whats-the-point" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="b-b-b-but-if-im-not-going-to-be-special-or-extraordinary-whats-the-point"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> B-b-b-but, if I’m not going to be special or extraordinary, what’s the point? </h3> <p>We all <em>deserve</em> greatness. “Average” has become the new standard of failure. Better to be at the extreme low end of the bell curve than to be in the middle, because at least there you’re still special and deserve attention.</p> <p><strong>People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great – they are mediocre, they are average – and that they could be so much better.</strong></p> <p>The pleasures of simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a good book, laughing with someone you care about. <strong>Ordinary things. They are ordinary for a reason: because they are what <em>actually</em> matters.</strong></p> <h2 id="the-value-of-suffering"> <a href="#the-value-of-suffering" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-value-of-suffering"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The value of suffering </h2> <p>Hiroo Onoda, the Japanese soldier who fought for many years refusing to believe the war did not end, choose to suffer for loyalty to a dead empire. Suzuki, the guy who discovered him, chose to suffer for adventure, no matter how ill-advised. Their suffering <em>meant</em> something. And because it meant something, they were able to endure it, or perhaps even enjoy it.</p> <p>The question we should be asking is not “How do I stop suffering?” but “Why am I suffering, for what purpose?”.</p> <h3 id="the-self-awareness-onion"> <a href="#the-self-awareness-onion" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-self-awareness-onion"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The self-awareness onion </h3> <ol> <li>First layer of self-awareness onion is a simple understanding of one’s emotions. “This is when I feel happy.” “This makes me feel sad.” “This gives me hope.”</li> <li>The second layer of self-awareness onion is an ability to ask <em>why</em> we feel certain emotions. This layer helps us understand the root cause of the emotions that overwhelm us. We can ideally do something to change it.</li> <li>The third level is our personal values: <em>Why</em> do I consider this to be success/failure? How am I choosing to measure myself? <strong>Our values determine the nature of our problems, and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives.</strong></li> </ol> <p>Much of the advice out there simply tries to make people feel good in the short term, while the real long-term problems never get solved.</p> <p>Problems may be inevitable, but the <em>meaning</em> of each problem is not.</p> <h3 id="rock-star-problems"> <a href="#rock-star-problems" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="rock-star-problems"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Rock star problems </h3> <p>The question is not <em>whether</em> we evaluate ourselves against others; rather, the question is by <em>what standard</em> do we measure ourselves?</p> <p>Our values determine the metrics by which we measure ourselves and everyone else.</p> <p>If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success.</p> <h3 id="shitty-values"> <a href="#shitty-values" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="shitty-values"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Shitty values </h3> <ol> <li><strong>Pleasure</strong>. Ask to a drug addict or an adulterer if they are happy. Pleasure is the most superficial form of life satisfaction and therefore the easiest to obtain and the easiest to lose. <strong>Pleasure is not the cause of happiness; rather it is the effect.</strong> If you get the values and metrics right, then pleasure will naturally occur as a by-product.</li> <li><strong>Material success</strong>. Research shows that once one is able to provide for basic physical needs (food, shelter, and so on), the correlation between happiness and worldly success quickly approaches zero. Another issue with this value is the danger of prioritising it over other values such as honesty, nonviolence, and compassion.</li> <li><strong>Always being right</strong>. As humans, we’re wrong pretty much constantly, you’re going to have a difficult time rationalising all of the bullshit to yourself. People who base their self-worth on being right about everything prevent themselves from learning from their mistakes. It’s far more helpful to assume that you’re ignorant and don’t know a whole lot.</li> <li><strong>Staying positive</strong>. Sometimes life sucks, and the healthiest thing you can do is admit it. Denying negative emotions leads to experiencing deeper and more prolonged negative emotions and to emotional dysfunction.</li> </ol> <p>To deny negativity is to <em>perpetuate</em> problems rather than solve them. The trick with negative emotions is to 1) express them in a socially acceptable and healthy manner and 2) express them in a way that aligns with your values.</p> <blockquote> <p>One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful – Freud</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="defining-good-and-bad-values"> <a href="#defining-good-and-bad-values" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="defining-good-and-bad-values"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Defining good and bad values </h3> <p><strong>Good values are 1) reality based, 2) socially constructive, and 3) immediate and controllable.</strong></p> <p><strong>Bad values are 1) superstitious, 2) socially destructive, and 3) not immediate or controllable.</strong></p> <p>People who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the shitty things they think about themselves being reflected back.</p> <p>Good, healthy values are achieved internally. Bad values are generally reliant on external events.</p> <p><strong>What <em>self-improvement</em> is really about: prioritising better values, choosing better thing to give a fuck about.</strong> Because when you give better fucks, you get better problems. And when you get better problems, you get a better life.</p> <p>Five counterintuitive values:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Responsibility</strong>. Taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who’s at fault.</li> <li><strong>Uncertainty</strong>. The acknowledgement of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs.</li> <li><strong>Failure</strong>.
